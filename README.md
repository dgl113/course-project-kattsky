1. Write your project proposal directly in this file in the section below. At a minimum, you should describe what a website you are going to work on and the 3 features that you plan to implement. See the project description on Brightspace for more details.

## Project Proposal

## Project Overview

The website chosen for the project is [Beaufort Association](https://nic-dgl103-f23-cvs3.github.io/project-kattsky/). This was a redesign project to fulfill the course requirement for DGL103 HTML/CSS. 

Below details the live Beaufort Association For Inclusion In Action website and its specific target audience. 

URL: https://beaufortassociation.ca/

Redesign project hosted on GitHub Page: https://nic-dgl103-f23-cvs3.github.io/project-kattsky/

Location: Courtenay, BC

Target Audience: 30-35 adults with developmental challenges

## Problem Statement

The current website [Beaufort Association](https://nic-dgl103-f23-cvs3.github.io/project-kattsky/) lacks interactive features to engage users effectively. It fails to provide seamless access to event details and input testimonials directly on the page. It also needs to provide accessibility features to individuals with visual challenges. Another thing it needs is an FAQ page to provide guidance to first time users of the website who are using it to join an event, to volunteer, and to donate. 

## Value Statement

Implementing below suggested features outlined in scope of work will greatly enhance the website's functionality and user experience. 

## Scope of Work

The following outlines the functionality of the future website which will be achieved using JavaScript.
1.	Carousel and pagination for Testimonials - to showcase testimonials and provide users easy navigation through them.
2.	Font Size Control – Uses buttons to dynamically adjust the font size on the website to cater individuals with visual challenges.
3.	Scroll to Top Button – to provide a convenient access to the beginning of the page, which ensures effortless navigation to top without manually scrolling.
